      "Page: Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act\n",
      "Summary: The Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, commonly known as House Bill 2, Bathroom Bill, or HB2, was a North Carolina statute passed in March 2016 and signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory. The bill amended state law to preempt any anti-discrimination ordinances passed by local communities and, controversially, compelled schools and state and local government facilities containing single-gender bathrooms to only allow people of the corresponding sex as listed on their birth certificate to use them; it also gave the state exclusive rights to determine the minimum wage.\n",
      "The bathroom portion of the bill generated immense criticism for preventing transgender people who did not or could not alter their birth certificates from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (at the time in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery could change the sex on their birth certificates, and outside jurisdictions have different rules, some more restrictive), and for changing the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.\" The removal of municipal anti-discrimination protections was also criticized, as state-level protections do not explicitly cover discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Opponents of the bill described it as the most anti-LGBT legislation in the United States, while proponents of HB2 called it \"common sense\" legislation.\n",
      "HB2 was met with widespread protests: state, county \u001b[0m\n",
