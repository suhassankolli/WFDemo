      "AI agents are also difficult to evaluate in a repeatable way that shows progress without employing artificial constraints. This is especially challenging as the core capabilities of the underlying LLMs continue to rapidly improve, which makes it difficult to know whether your approach has improved results or if it's simply the underlying ... An AI agent is a software component that has the agency to act on behalf of a user or a system to perform tasks.Users can organize agents into systems that can orchestrate complex workflows, coordinate activities among multiple agents, apply logic to thorny problems, and evaluate answers to user queries. Limitations of AI Agents. AI agents have undoubtedly transformed many industries, but they come with limitations that impact their reliability, adaptability, and ethical use. Here are some of the main limitations: Limited Understanding of Context Many AI agents lack the deep understanding of context that humans have. An AI agent is a software program that can interact with its surroundings, gather information, and use that information to complete tasks on its own to achieve goals set by humans.. For instance, an AI agent on an online shopping platform can recommend products, answer customer questions, and process orders. If agent needs more information, it can ask users for additional details. AI agents are capable of operating independently and without continuous, direct oversight, while collaborating with users to automate monotonous tasks.\n"
